# Age_Gender-Prediction
 Jovac Capstone Project on topic - Age and Gender Prediction (based on ConvNets or other Neural Networks).
# DataSet
  In this project I have used ```UTKFace Dataset``` which can easily be downloaded from kaggle or from the google drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ysIb0JHDIXHQ0pTIsn0XePQ7SER1vRQH?usp=sharing 
  ### Example of the DataSet :

  ### DataSet Description : 
   UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.
